# Kobo's at it again.
First, if you are reading this, this is just me having an complete mental breakdown about this process.
## FAQ

What is this? Its the process of me converting Minecraft:Java into C, so I guess it would be Minecraft:C Edition.

What is the point of this? Stir up something, to prove that it'll take no fucking time to convert minecraft into C.

What'll feature? Minecraft, lol, honestly Java is a language to mess up in and still get something good.

What did you use? MCP43(Minecraft-Coding-Pack_43/B1.7.3), Java2C, Python3.9.5

# TODO
Decompile B1.7.3

Convert Java/Class files to C

Compile C files into an executable

Make Minecraft at least go to Main Menu.

# COMPLAINTS
## Pisson-3
Installing Python-3 is easy but complicated to install, they like to put their source-code/linux build in an tar.xz, which require their own tools.
Why the synpatic package manager won't adopt python-3 as its own package, I will never understand; But for now thats at least one step down. Why couldn't they just make it into an executable. TIP: Remember to fucking put it all in as 1 command, and not seperate. It's gonna take long, compiling is an ass, just play something while you wait. Note: its like decompiling KH2FM

## MC-fuck me my asshole is going.
Woah baby, isn't this an popular take. Minecraft is an fucking nightmare? Well it didn't used to be, but first some context. The MCPv43 was made in a time where the launcher isn't shit. A time where only 1 version existed at a time. After 1.0, Notch/Mojang decided to update the launcher, adding more versions. This was kinda the downfall until we flash-forward to 2020, where the versions folder is an shitshow, and work arounds gettings patched out. Just use MulitMC.
