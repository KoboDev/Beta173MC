# Holy Shit
First, if you are reading this, this is just me having an complete mental breakdown about this process.

# COMPLAINTS
## Pisson-3
Installing Python-3 is easy but complicated to install, they like to put their source-code/linux build in an tar.xz, which require their own tools.
Why the synpatic package manager won't adopt python-3 as its own package, I will never understand; But for now thats at least one step down. Why couldn't they just make it into an executable. TIP: Remember to fucking put it all in as 1 command, and not seperate. It's gonna take long, compiling is an ass, just play something while you wait. Note: its like decompiling KH2FM
