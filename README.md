# Kobo's at it again.
First, if you are reading this, this is just me having an complete mental breakdown about this process.
## FAQ

What is this? Its the process of me converting Minecraft:Java into C, so I guess it would be Minecraft:C Edition.

What is the point of this? Stir up something, to prove that it'll take no fucking time to convert minecraft into C.

What'll feature? Minecraft, lol, honestly Java is a language to mess up in and still get something good.

What did you use? MCP43(Minecraft-Coding-Pack_43/B1.7.3), Java2C, Python3.9.5

# TODO
Decompile B1.7.3

Convert Java/Class files to C

Compile C files into an executable

Make Minecraft at least go to Main Menu.

# COMPLAINTS
## Pisson-3
Installing Python-3 is easy but complicated to install, they like to put their source-code/linux build in an tar.xz, which require their own tools.
Why the synpatic package manager won't adopt python-3 as its own package, I will never understand; But for now thats at least one step down. Why couldn't they just make it into an executable. TIP: Remember to fucking put it all in as 1 command, and not seperate. It's gonna take long, compiling is an ass, just play something while you wait. Note: its like decompiling KH2FM
